# Python Learning Journey 🐍

A complete, beginner-friendly repository documenting my step-by-step journey in learning Python from scratch.

This repo contains my notes, practice programs, solved challenges, and mini-projects—all inspired by:

- **📘 Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (ATBS)** – for practical beginner automation topics.
- **💻 Coddy.tech** – for hands-on coding challenges and structured Python practice.

This repository is designed to show consistent learning, clean coding habits, and beginner → intermediate Python mastery.
